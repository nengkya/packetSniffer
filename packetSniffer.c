    Address Format :
    AF_LOCAL
    this designates the address format that goes with the local namespace.
    AF_UNIX
    this is a synonym for AF_LOCAL. Although AF_LOCAL is mandated by POSIX.1g,
    AF_UNIX is portable to more systems.
    AF_UNIX was the traditional name stemming from BSD, so even most POSIX systems support it.
    it is also the name of choice in the Unix98 specification.
    The same is true for PF_UNIX vs PF_LOCAL. PF is Protocol Format.
    AF_FILE
    this is another synonym for AF_LOCAL, for compatibility.
    PF_FILE is likewise a synonym for PF_LOCAL.
    AF_INET
    this designates the address format that goes with the Internet namespace.
    PF_INET is the name of that namespace.
    AF_INET6
    this is similar to AF_INET, but refers to the IPv6 protocol.
    PF_INET6 is the name of the corresponding namespace.
    AF_UNSPEC
    this designates no particular address format. It is used only in rare cases,
    such as to clear out the default destination address of a “connected” datagram socket.
